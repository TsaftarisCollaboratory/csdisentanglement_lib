# csdisentanglement_lib
This repository constists of the implementations of the Distance Correlation (DC) and Information Over Bias (IOB) metrics proposed in [link]. The two metrics can be used to assess the level of disentanglement between spatial content and vector style representations. Both metrics are ready to use with PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations.
